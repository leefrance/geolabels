# Geolabels
OpenSource lines for cartographic labeling of physical geographic features

## Brief
The purpose of this repository and data is to start a centralized dataset of lines representing physical features used for labeling in various types of cartographic outputs. As of its creation it consists of approximately 1300 geographic line features covering both land and sea globally. The data primarily represents small scale physical features with the hope of growing it into a dataset useful at all scales. 

The intial data was created from two different sources. 

*   Centerlines from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-physical-labels/) physical label areas using the voronoi diagram based [centerline tool](https://github.com/ungarj/label_centerlines). 
*   Lines extracted from Tom Patterson's new [Physical Map of the Contiguous US](http://www.shadedrelief.com/us-physical/) using MapPublisher. 

## The Data


## Contributing
This project is at the ground floor with the hopes that the cartographic community will get involved and expand upon this data for the benefit of all map makers. For now the data exists as one simple geojson file. In time, if involvement increases and the data grows we will explore necessary avenues to improving upon the editing and contribution process.

For now,
